Fact:    Baking chocolate is the most dangerous chocolate to your cat.
Fact:    The cat's clavicle, or collarbone, does not connect with other bones but is buried in the muscles of the shoulder region. This lack of a functioning collarbone allows them to fit through any opening the size of their head.
Fact:    A cat's nose pad is ridged with a unique pattern, just like the fingerprint of a human.
Fact:    Contrary to popular belief, the cat is a social animal. A pet cat will respond and answer to speech , and seems to enjoy human companionship.
Fact:    Abraham Lincoln loved cats. He had four of them while he lived in the White House.
